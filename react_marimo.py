    ### **Understanding the Statistical Concepts for Outlier detection**

    ##### Features in predicting the target variable contains outliers which might overfit the trained model. In order to detect outliers, we'll understand the concept of ***Probability distribution Function*** which is a mathematical function which describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. It consists of two types:

    **PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTION (PMF)** : Probability function which assigns probabilities to discrete random variables. It forms a distribution of prb. of each discrete random variable.

    **PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION (PDF)** : Probability function represents probability density at a given point and it is used for continuous random variables. Here the prb. of a given point remains zero.

    **CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION (CDF)** : Function which represents the prb. of a random variable less than or equal to a specific value. A 50% prb. in terms of CDF indicates that we've `accumulated` half of the probability density distribution. 

    **NOTE**ðŸš¨: The Inverse of CDF is known as **Percent Point Function (PPF)**.
